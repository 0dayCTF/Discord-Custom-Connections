# Discord Custom Connections
Add custom connections to your Discord profile!
<h2>Submitting the PUT request</h2>
<p>
  ∙ Navigate to Discord in the browser to find your authorization token <a href="https://discordhelp.net/discord-token">(How To Find Token)</a>
  <br>
  ∙  Change the token in the request to your own, and add some random integers after <i>/connections/battlenet/</i><b>HERE</b> 
  <br>
∙ Using python, execute <b>CustomConnections.py</b>
<br>
∙ To remove, just change the script to <b>DELETE</b> instead of <b>PUT</b>, make sure you use the same integers in the request!
