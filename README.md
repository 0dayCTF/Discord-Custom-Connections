# Discord Custom Connections
Add custom connections to your Discord profile!
<h2>Submitting the PUT request</h2>
<p>
  ∙ Navigate to Discord in the browser to find your authorization token <a href="https://discordhelp.net/discord-token">(How To Find Token)</a>
  <br>
∙ Using python, execute <b>CustomConnections.py</b> (make sure you installed requests eg: pip install requests)
<br>
∙ To remove, just change the script to <b>DELETE</b> instead of <b>PUT</b>, or just remove from Discord manually in your settings!
<br>
<center><h3>Feel free to test other endpoints, "leaugeoflegends", "skype", and "battlenet" appear to work! </h3> 
  <br><i>Be careful of the "contacts" endpoint, it will cause your Discord to crash until removed!</i></center>
